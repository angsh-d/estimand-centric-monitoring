1. PROVENANCE: The system never shows its work
This is the biggest gap. Every extraction screen presents results as fait accompli with no citation back to source documents.
Screen 3 (SOA Review): When MADRS shows a checkmark at Week 4, the user has no way to verify where in the protocol PDF the system found that. A study director looking at this will ask "how do I know it didn't hallucinate an assessment at a visit?" There should be a way to click any cell and see the source — "Protocol Section 6.1, Table 3, Page 47" with a rendered snippet of the relevant protocol page. This is the difference between a tool someone trusts and one they have to independently verify anyway (defeating the purpose).
Screen 8 (Estimands): The 96% confidence badge is meaningless without provenance. Where in the SAP did the system find this estimand? Which section defined the population? Which paragraph specified the intercurrent event strategy? Each component (population, treatment, variable, ICE) should cite its SAP source — "SAP Section 3.1, Page 12" — and the confidence score should decompose: "Population: 98% (explicit definition found), ICE Strategy: 89% (inferred from Section 5.2 language, not explicitly stated as estimand component)." That decomposition is what makes the confidence score actionable rather than decorative.
Screen 9 (Derivation Map): The derivation logic column says "MADRS total = sum of 10 items" — but where in the SAP is this derivation defined? The whole point of this screen is traceability. Each row should carry dual provenance: aCRF source (which CRF form, which CDASH annotation) and SAP source (which section defines this derivation). Without it, the traceability claim in your subtitle — "Source (aCRF) → Analysis (SAP) → Estimand" — is aspirational, not demonstrated.

2. HITL: The human can approve but can't actually intervene
The current flow gives the user "Approve" buttons but very limited ability to correct the system's output. This makes HITL ceremonial rather than substantive.
Screen 3 (SOA Review): What if the system missed an assessment? What if it got a visit window wrong? What if the protocol has a conditional visit (e.g., "unscheduled safety visit if AE occurs") that the system didn't capture? The user needs inline editing capability — click a cell to toggle an assessment on/off, click a visit header to edit the window, and an "Add Assessment" / "Add Visit" option. Additionally, there should be an "AI didn't capture" section at the bottom showing assessments the system detected but wasn't confident enough to include, letting the user pull them back in. This is where HITL becomes real — the system shows its uncertainty and the human resolves it.
Screen 5 (aCRF Domains): Same problem. What if CDASH mapping is wrong — the system mapped an assessment to QS but it should be FA (Findings About)? What if a controlled terminology value is incorrect? Each cell in this table should be editable with a visual indicator showing "AI-generated" vs. "human-modified." The domain pills should also allow adding a domain the system missed entirely.
Screen 8 (Estimands): "Approve Estimands" as a single button is dangerous. What if E1 is perfect but E2 is wrong? Per-estimand confirmation (which you had in the prototype) is essential. More importantly — what if the system missed an estimand? There should be an explicit "Add Estimand" option with a note: "The system identified 2 estimands. If your SAP defines additional estimands (e.g., sensitivity estimands, supplementary estimands), add them here."
Screen 9 (Derivation Map): This appears completely read-only. This is the screen where the most consequential errors can occur — a wrong derivation link means a wrong tier assignment means monitoring effort directed at the wrong data points. The user needs: ability to edit derivation logic, ability to correct the estimand link, ability to add rows for derivation chains the system missed, ability to remove rows that are incorrect. Each row should also show a provenance indicator — "mapped automatically" vs. "requires human verification" (for lower-confidence mappings).

3. EXPLAINABILITY: Confidence without reasoning is decoration
Screen 8 (Estimands): The 96% confidence badge appears but there's no "why." A clinical team will ask: "96% based on what?" Confidence should decompose into the components that drive it. For example: "Estimand structure explicitly stated in SAP Section 3.1 (high confidence). Population definition uses standard ICH E9(R1) language (high confidence). Composite strategy for rescue medication inferred from SAP Section 5.2.3 wording rather than explicit estimand table (moderate confidence — verify)." This turns the confidence score from a number into a review guide — the user knows exactly where to focus their validation effort.
Screen 10 (Criticality Review): The tier assignments have an "Estimand Impact" column which is good, but the reasoning chain is invisible. Why is VISITNUM Tier 1? The user needs to see: "VISITNUM → maps to AVISIT/AVISITN → required for MMRM repeated measures structure → MMRM is primary analysis method (SAP Section 4.1) → without correct visit mapping, primary analysis model cannot be fit → Tier 1." This is the derivation chain that justifies the tier. Without it, the user is reviewing tier assignments they can't actually evaluate. Consider an expandable row or side panel that shows the full reasoning chain for any field.

4. AUDIT TRAIL: No distinction between AI output and human decisions
This is critical for regulatory defensibility. Nowhere in the current flow does the system track:

What the AI originally proposed vs. what the human accepted, modified, or overrode
When a human changed a tier assignment, what was the original AI assignment?
If the user edits the SOA (adds a missing assessment), that's clearly a human contribution vs. AI extraction

The completion screen (Screen 11) should include an audit summary: "AI-generated: 14 of 16 derivation chains. Human-modified: 2 (VISITNUM tier changed from 2→1, rescue medication link corrected). Human-added: 0. All estimands AI-extracted, both confirmed without modification." This audit provenance is what makes the model defensible to a regulatory reviewer or during an inspection.

5. STRUCTURAL FLOW ISSUES
The breadcrumb (Protocol > Analysis > Data Source) doesn't map to what the user is actually doing. It should reflect the conceptual stages of the model-building process: "Protocol → aCRF → SAP → Criticality Model" — and the active segment should correspond to the current step. This also helps the user understand where they are in the overall process at a glance.
Missing: System flags and warnings. The system should actively surface things it's uncertain about or things that look unusual, rather than presenting everything with equal confidence. Examples: "MADRS is collected at Screening but not at Follow-up — intentional?" or "No explicit rescue medication definition found in protocol — the intercurrent event mapping for E1 may require manual input" or "CGI-I is listed in the SOA but no corresponding estimand references CGI-I — confirm this is intentionally Tier 3." These flags are what make the system feel like a thinking partner rather than a document processor.
Missing: Step 6. Your flow says "Step 1 of 6" through "Step 5 of 6" but the Model Complete screen doesn't show a Step 6. If Step 6 is the finalization/export, it should be labeled. If it's not a step, the total should be 5.
Screen 10 (Criticality Review): The table columns should be "Source Field | Analysis Variable | Estimand Impact | Assigned Tier" — but should add a "Domain" column (which your implementation has in the left column, good) AND the tier filter pills from the prototype. Letting the user filter by "show me only Tier 1" or "show me only Tier 3" helps them validate the extremes: "are all the Tier 1s truly critical?" and "is anything in Tier 3 that should be higher?"
Screen 11 (Model Complete): "SME Validation: Pending" is the right concept but it's floating as a passive status. It should be an action: "Route to SME for Validation" with the ability to select the statistician and medical monitor who need to review. The pending status should block "Generate RBQM Package" — an unvalidated model should not produce a monitoring package. This is where the system demonstrates that it takes the HITL principle seriously at the consequence level, not just the workflow level.
