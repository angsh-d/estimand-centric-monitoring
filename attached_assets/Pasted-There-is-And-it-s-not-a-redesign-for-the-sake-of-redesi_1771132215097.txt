There is. And it's not a redesign for the sake of redesign — it flows directly from the thesis you built on Slide 4 of the deck: "The estimand defines what matters. Monitoring should follow."
The current dashboard is signal-centric: here's a list of alerts, sorted by severity, go work through them. That's the paradigm every monitoring tool has used for 15 years. Your recommended changes would make it a better version of that paradigm — better reasoning, better provenance, better evidence. But it's still the same paradigm.
The transformative version is estimand-centric: the primary object on screen isn't a signal list — it's the health of what determines whether your study succeeds or fails. Signals exist as evidence feeding that assessment, not as the primary unit of work.
Here's what I'd propose — a three-layer architecture:
Layer 1: Estimand Health (the strategic view). This is what the study director and medical monitor see first. Two or three cards — one per estimand — showing the current integrity status of each study objective. The primary estimand card shows the derivation chain components (MADRS items, baseline, visit windows, rescue medication, treatment exposure) and which components currently have open threats. You can see at a glance: "Primary endpoint derivation is intact except for two active threats — one to the rescue medication classification at Site 109, one to MADRS data completeness at Site 402." That's a fundamentally different starting point than "you have 24 open signals."
Layer 2: Threat Narratives (the investigation view). When you click into a threatened component, you don't get a flat signal card — you get the AI's narrative synthesis of what's happening. For the rescue medication classification threat: "Subject 109-004 at Charité Berlin has a 2-day date discrepancy between EDC and Safety Narrative for a concomitant medication that may qualify as rescue medication under the protocol's composite strategy. If the earlier date (Jan 12, from EDC) is correct, this medication was administered before the Week 8 MADRS assessment, and the subject's primary endpoint value should be imputed as treatment failure. If the later date (Jan 14, from Safety Narrative) is correct, the medication was administered after the assessment and does not trigger the composite rule. Resolution of this 2-day discrepancy directly affects the primary analysis for this subject." Below the narrative: the multi-source evidence cards, the provenance citations, the recommended action, the audit trail.
Layer 3: Signal Queue (the operational view). This is closer to what you have now — the CRA's working list. But it's organized by estimand threat, not by chronological arrival. The CRA sees: "Primary Estimand Threats (2 signals) → Key Secondary Threats (1 signal) → Safety Signals (3 signals) → Compliance & Operational (18 signals)." Within each group, signals carry their full reasoning chains and recommended actions. The CRA works top-down, knowing that the ordering reflects analytical consequence, not just severity labels.
The key insight: different users enter at different layers. The medical monitor lives in Layer 1 — they want the strategic picture. The CRA lives in Layer 3 — they need to work through individual findings. The study director moves between Layer 1 and Layer 2 — they need to understand which threats matter and why. One dashboard serving all three, with the estimand as the organizing principle rather than an afterthought tag.
This is the UX that makes the Criticality Model Builder pay off. Without it, you built a beautiful model and then threw it away at the point of consumption. With it, every monitoring interaction is structured by what the model determined matters most.
