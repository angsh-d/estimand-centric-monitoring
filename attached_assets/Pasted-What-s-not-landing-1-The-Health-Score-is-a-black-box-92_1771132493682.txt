What's not landing:
1. The Health Score is a black box. 92% means nothing without decomposition. How is it calculated? Which components are dragging it down? The user sees "92%" and "Integrity Risk" but can't answer "92% of what?" The health score should visually decompose into the components below it — and the components should show their individual status. Right now the component circles are tiny, undifferentiated, and the badge numbers (3 on Visit Windows, 1 on Rescue Medication) are barely visible. These components ARE the story. They should be the dominant visual element, not footnotes under a percentage.
Consider: instead of a single 92% number, show each component as a bar or status indicator: "MADRS Assessment: ✓ Intact | Baseline Definition: ✓ Intact | Visit Windows: ⚠ 3 open signals | Rescue Medication: ⚠ 1 open signal | Treatment Exposure: ✓ Intact." Now the user instantly sees that 3 of 5 derivation components are clean and 2 are threatened. That's enormously more actionable than "92%."
2. Layer 2 is completely missing. This was the most important layer — the Threat Narrative. When I click "Rescue Medication" (which has 1 signal), I should see the AI's synthesis: the narrative explaining why this threat matters, the multi-source evidence, the analytical consequence, the recommended action. The current layout jumps straight from Layer 1 (estimand health) to Layer 3 (signal queue table). Without Layer 2, the user still has to do the interpretive work themselves — they see "Conmed Date Mismatch (Lorazepam)" in the queue but have no bridge explaining how a Lorazepam date discrepancy threatens the primary estimand's rescue medication composite strategy.
3. The Signal Queue table lost all the richness. The table is cleaner than the original card-based layout, but it's now too sparse. "Conmed Date Mismatch (Lorazepam)" is a title with no reasoning, no evidence, no provenance, no recommended action. It's actually less informative than the original dashboard, which at least had a one-line description. The table format works for the queue, but each row needs to expand (progressive disclosure) into the evidence synthesis and reasoning chain when clicked.
4. The "LAYER 1" and "LAYER 3" labels should not be visible. These are architectural concepts for us, not user-facing labels. Users don't think in layers. The Estimand Health section should just be at the top. The Signal Queue should just be below it. The hierarchy communicates itself through position and visual weight without needing meta-labels.
My recommendation: Don't redesign from scratch — the bones are right. But the estimand cards need to be richer (component-level status instead of a single percentage), Layer 2 needs to exist as an expanded state when you click a threatened component, the signal queue rows need progressive disclosure into evidence and reasoning, and the layer labels need to go. Those four changes would deliver the vision. Want me to build a working prototype that shows all three layers with the interactions?
