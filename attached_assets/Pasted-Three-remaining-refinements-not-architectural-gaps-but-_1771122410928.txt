Three remaining refinements — not architectural gaps, but things that would push this from strong to exceptional:
1. Source citation on hover/click is still the biggest differentiator you haven't shown yet. The "AI EXTRACTED" badge tells the user that it was extracted. But when a study director looks at the MADRS row and sees a checkmark at Week 2, they need to be able to click it and see: "Protocol Section 6.1, Schedule of Assessments, Table 3, Page 47." This is the single feature that separates "AI tool I have to independently verify" from "AI tool that accelerates my verification." If this is planned but just not visible in the screenshots, you're fine. If it's not planned, it should be the next thing you build. The implementation doesn't need to be heavy — a simple tooltip or a right-panel that shows the source snippet when you click a cell would be sufficient.
2. The SOA screen should surface what the AI is uncertain about, not just what it found. Right now every row looks identical — same checkmark style, same visual weight. But in practice, the system will have high confidence about some extractions (MADRS clearly appears in a clean SOA table) and lower confidence about others (maybe "Drug Accountability" was inferred from a paragraph in Section 8.3 rather than explicitly listed in the SOA table). Consider a subtle visual treatment for lower-confidence extractions — a dashed border on the checkmark, or a small "?" icon — that draws the reviewer's attention to the rows where their human judgment is most needed. This is how you make HITL efficient rather than just possible: instead of "review all 14 rows equally," it becomes "the system is confident about 11 of these, focus your attention on these 3."
3. The Model Complete screen (Image 11 from the first batch) should gate the RBQM Package behind SME validation. You have "SME Validation: Pending" as a status card, which is good. But "Generate RBQM Package" is still an active button sitting right next to it. An unvalidated model generating a monitoring package is exactly the kind of operational risk that a regulatory-minded audience would flag. Make the RBQM button disabled with a tooltip: "Requires SME sign-off before generating monitoring package." This is a small UI change that sends a large signal about how seriously the platform takes the validation gate.
